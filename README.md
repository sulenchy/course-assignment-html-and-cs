# course-assignment-html-and-css

![Screenshot of project](/images/Screenshot.png)

For this assignment I have created a properly functioning, responsive website for the assigment brief I chose in Design 1. The website contains every page listed in the site architecture on the chosen brief.

- Home
- List of videos
- A video page showing the product details
- A checkout page
- A checkout success
- About
- Contact

I made some small adjustments from the original prototype in Figma when I created the website with html and css. I also updated the page based on the feedback I received from the submission in Design 1.

I have created this website by following the course modules, and slowly but surely put into practice everything I have learned about HTML and CSS over this course.

The website have been created in Visual Studio Code, where I have installed and used Live Server to follow the process of creating the website. I also created an account on the Font Awesome website, where I got the icons on the website from.
